I worked at Joby Aviation for 8 years as a mechanical engineer. There, I led a team that developed mechanisms and composites structures for the Joby S4, I then joined the flight research team to design mechanisms and mechanical systems for special projects.

Prior to Joby, I earned a B.S. in Mechanical and Industrial engineering from Arts et Metiers ParisTech (France) and a M.S. in Aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan.

I have a passion for product design, system integration and testing. My current focus is on human augmentation in medicine and rehabilitation.
